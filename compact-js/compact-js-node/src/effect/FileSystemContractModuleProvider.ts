/**
 * A {@link CompactRuntime.ContractModuleProvider} that resolves generated contract modules lazily
 * from the file system.
 *
 * Each callee's module is imported from `<baseFolderPath>/<address>/contract/index.js` — the layout
 * `compactc` writes, with the managed output directory named by the address it is deployed at.
 * Modules are imported **on demand**: a module is loaded only once a call actually resolves to its
 * address, so a directory may hold more contracts than any one execution reaches, and none is paid
 * for until it is called.
 *
 * An address with nothing on disk resolves to `undefined`, which the runtime reports as an
 * unsupported implementation. A module that is there but cannot be loaded, such as a link whose
 * target was removed, fails the load instead, naming the path.
 *
 * A generated module imports `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime` by bare specifier, and Node resolves
 * that from the module's real path. A module copied outside the project therefore cannot load, and
 * one inside another project loads a second copy of the runtime. Keep `baseFolderPath` inside the
 * project, or fill it with symlinks to compiled directories there.
 *
 * @param baseFolderPath The folder holding one managed contract directory per address.
 * @param modulePathForAddress Maps a contract address to its module's path within `baseFolderPath`.
 * Override this if the on-disk layout differs from `compactc`'s.
 * @returns A {@link CompactRuntime.ContractModuleProvider} backed by `baseFolderPath`.
 *
 * @category constructors
