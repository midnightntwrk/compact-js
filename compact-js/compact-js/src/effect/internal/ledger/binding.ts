/**
 * The contract every era binding module (`v8.ts`, `v9.ts`, a future `v10.ts`, …) must satisfy.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Checking a binding happens in two stages, because presence alone is not enough and a single
 * interface cannot express the rest:
 *
 * 1. {@link LedgerBinding} — every name the facade re-exports is present, callable, and
 *    constructible with the right arity. Parameters are typed `never` so any concrete parameter
 *    type satisfies them (parameters are contravariant): this stage deliberately does *not*
 *    pin the era's own types, because they legitimately differ between eras.
 * 2. {@link LedgerBindingViolations} — the *relationships between* a binding's members hold. This
 *    is where signature drift is caught: each check projects the binding's own types with
 *    `ReturnType`/`ConstructorParameters`/`InstanceType` and asserts the pairs that compact-js
 *    actually composes still fit together, whatever the era's concrete types are.
 *
 * Stage 2 exists because stage 1 used to be the whole contract, with every member typed
 * `unknown`. That made conformance a presence check: a binding could re-export a name whose
 * signature had drifted and still satisfy the contract, with the breakage surfacing far
 * downstream at a call site. Relational checks catch it at the binding, and — unlike writing the
 * expected signatures out by hand — they do not duplicate the ledger package's declarations,
 * which remain authoritative for their own shapes.
 *
 * Type-only exports are erased from `typeof <module>` entirely and cannot be constrained by an
 * interface; they are pinned in `conformance.ts` and `test/typetests/effect/Ledger.tst.ts`
 * instead.
