/**
 * Compile-time conformance for **every** ledger era binding, whether or not `current.ts` names it.
 *
 * @remarks
 * `current.ts` only asserts the binding it re-exports,. Listing each
 * binding here means the build checks all of them on every run, which is what lets a new era be
 * developed against the contract before anything points at it.
 *
 * Three things are checked per binding, because no one of them is sufficient:
 *
 * 1. **Presence** — `typeof M extends LedgerBinding`: every name the facade re-exports exists and
 *    is callable/constructible with the right arity.
 * 2. **Relationships** — `LedgerBindingViolations<typeof M>` is `never`: the member pairs compact-js
 *    composes still fit together. This is the stage that catches *signature* drift, which presence
 *    alone cannot see.
 * 3. **Type-only exports** — named explicitly below, because `typeof M` erases them entirely and
 *    no interface can constrain them.
 *
 * `import type` only: this module is erased entirely, so adding a binding here costs no bundle size
 * and cannot instantiate a second ledger WASM (the property `LedgerEra.test.ts` guards).
 *
 * Add one block per binding. There is deliberately no runtime export.
 *
