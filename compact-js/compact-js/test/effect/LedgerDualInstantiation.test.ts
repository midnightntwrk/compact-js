// Pins *upstream* behaviour, not compact-js's: wasm-bindgen guards most entry points with
// `_assertClass`, but a handful take `JsValue` and discard the failed downcast, so a foreign handle
// reads back as absent. The condition is dual instantiation, not era mismatch — two copies of the
// *same* version behave identically. When an `UNGUARDED` case starts throwing, move it to `GUARDED`.
